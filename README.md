## Project Title: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data Detection

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to identify PII in text data. PII detection is important for several reasons:
- <b>Privacy Protection</b>: PII includes sensitive details about individuals, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Detecting and safeguarding PII ensures that personal data remains private and secure.
- <b>Legal Compliance</b>: Many data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) mandate strict handling of PII. Organizations must comply with these regulations to avoid legal penalties.
- <b>Risk Mitigation</b>: Mishandling PII can lead to identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized access. Detecting PII helps mitigate these risks.
- <b>Machine Learning and NLP</b>: Detecting PII is important when training machine learning models, especially for tasks involving natural language processing (NLP). It ensures that models don‚Äôt accidentally learn and reveal personal data.

## Challenges
- <b>Variability in PII Formats</b>: PII can appear in various formats (e.g., full names, usernames, initials), making detection challenging.
- <b>Context Dependency</b>: The presence of PII often depends on the context (e.g., an address within a resume vs. an email body has different implicationsl).
- <b>Data Imbalance</b>: PII entities are relatively rare in large datasets. Imbalanced classes affect model training.

## Approach
For this project, i use a dataset from a Kaggle competition ‚Äò[The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data)‚Äô. The competition was open from 18<sup>th</sup> January 2024 to 24<sup>th</sup> April 2024 with the goal to develop a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing. I aim to train a model with the objective of achieving a high score on the competition leaderboard üèÜ.

### __[The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data)__ 
#### Overview
The goal of this competition is to develop a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing.

#### Data
##### Data Description
1. The competition dataset comprises approximately 22,000 essays written by students.
2. A majority of the essays are reserved for the test set (70%)

##### PII Entities
- NAME_STUDENT - The full or partial name of a student that is not necessarily the author of the essay. This excludes instructors, authors, and other person names.
- EMAIL - A student‚Äôs email address.
- USERNAME - A student's username on any platform.
- ID_NUM - A number or sequence of characters that could be used to identify a student, such as a student ID or a social security number.
- PHONE_NUM - A phone number associated with a student.
- URL_PERSONAL - A URL that might be used to identify a student.
- STREET_ADDRESS - A full or partial street address that is associated with the student, such as their home address.

##### File and Field Information
- The data is presented in JSON format. 
- The documents were tokenized using the SpaCy English tokenizer.
- Token labels are presented in BIO (Beginning, Inner, Outer) format. (e.g.: Waseem Mabunda and Emily -> B-NAME_STUDENT, I-NAME_STUDENT, O, B-NAME_STUDENT)
- {test|train}.json - the test and training data; the test data given on this page is for illustrative purposes only, and will be replaced during Code rerun with a hidden test set.
  1. (int): the index of the essay
  2. document (int): an integer ID of the essay
  3. full_text (string): a UTF-8 representation of the essay
  4. tokens (string): a string representation of each token (list)
  5. trailing_whitespace (bool): a boolean value indicating whether each token is followed by whitespace (list)
  6. labels (string) [training data only]: a token label in BIO format (list)
- Token labels are presented in BIO (Beginning, Inner, Outer) format. 
  - PII type is prefixed with ‚ÄúB-‚Äù when it is the beginning of an entity. 
  - PII type is prefixed with ‚ÄúI-‚Äù PII type if the token is a continuation of an entity.
  - Tokens that are not PII are labeled ‚ÄúO‚Äù.
