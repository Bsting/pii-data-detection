## Project Title: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Data Detection

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to identify PII in text data. PII detection is important for several reasons:
- <b>Privacy Protection</b>: PII includes sensitive details about individuals, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers. Detecting and safeguarding PII ensures that personal data remains private and secure.
- <b>Legal Compliance</b>: Many data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) mandate strict handling of PII. Organizations must comply with these regulations to avoid legal penalties.
- <b>Risk Mitigation</b>: Mishandling PII can lead to identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized access. Detecting PII helps mitigate these risks.
- <b>Machine Learning and NLP</b>: Detecting PII is important when training machine learning models, especially for tasks involving natural language processing (NLP). It ensures that models don‚Äôt accidentally learn and reveal personal data.

## Challenges
- <b>Variability in PII Formats</b>: PII can appear in various formats (e.g., full names, usernames, initials), making detection challenging.
- <b>Context Dependency</b>: The presence of PII often depends on the context (e.g., an address within a resume vs. an email body has different implications).
- <b>Data Imbalance</b>: PII entities are relatively rare in large datasets. Imbalanced classes affect model training.

## Approach
For this project, i use a dataset from a Kaggle competition ‚Äò[The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data)‚Äô. The competition was open from 18<sup>th</sup> January 2024 to 24<sup>th</sup> April 2024 with the goal to develop a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing. I aim to train a model with the objective of achieving a high score on the competition leaderboard üèÜ.

### __[The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data)__ 
#### Overview
The goal of this competition is to develop a model that detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing.

#### Data
##### Data Description
1. The competition dataset comprises approximately 22,000 essays written by students.
2. A majority of the essays are reserved for the test set (70%)

##### PII Entities
- NAME_STUDENT - The full or partial name of a student that is not necessarily the author of the essay. This excludes instructors, authors, and other person names.
- EMAIL - A student‚Äôs email address.
- USERNAME - A student's username on any platform.
- ID_NUM - A number or sequence of characters that could be used to identify a student, such as a student ID or a social security number.
- PHONE_NUM - A phone number associated with a student.
- URL_PERSONAL - A URL that might be used to identify a student.
- STREET_ADDRESS - A full or partial street address that is associated with the student, such as their home address.

##### File and Field Information
- The data is presented in JSON format. 
- The documents were tokenized using the SpaCy English tokenizer.
- Token labels are presented in BIO (Beginning, Inner, Outer) format. (e.g.: Waseem Mabunda and Emily -> B-NAME_STUDENT, I-NAME_STUDENT, O, B-NAME_STUDENT)
- {test|train}.json - the test and training data; the test data given on this page is for illustrative purposes only, and will be replaced during Code rerun with a hidden test set.
  1. (int): the index of the essay
  2. document (int): an integer ID of the essay
  3. full_text (string): a UTF-8 representation of the essay
  4. tokens (string): a string representation of each token (list)
  5. trailing_whitespace (bool): a boolean value indicating whether each token is followed by whitespace (list)
  6. labels (string) [training data only]: a token label in BIO format (list)
- Token labels are presented in BIO (Beginning, Inner, Outer) format. 
  - PII type is prefixed with ‚ÄúB-‚Äù when it is the beginning of an entity. 
  - PII type is prefixed with ‚ÄúI-‚Äù PII type if the token is a continuation of an entity.
  - Tokens that are not PII are labeled ‚ÄúO‚Äù.

### 1. Data Collection
Collect data from [The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data) and perform EDA on the data.

### 2. Data Processing
Process and prepare the data to ensure its suitability for model training.

### 3. Algorithm Selection
Select hyperparameters and a specific variant of a model family for training.

### 4. Model Training
Fit the model with the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model performance by submitting the inference results to the competition. There are 2 scores: the public score and the private score.
- The public score is calculated by using approximately 20% of the test data, and this score is calculated after the inference results successfully submitted.
- The private score is calculated by using approximately 80% of the test data, and this score is calculated after the competition end. 

## Experiment
Observations from the EDA done on the data collected from [The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data):
- training dataset has imbalanced classes
- 86.12% of the documents with non-PII entity i.e. 'O' label (non-PII) only.
- 99.95% of the labels is non-PII entity ('O' label).
- label 'B-NAME_STUDENT' and 'I-NAME_STUDENT' for entity 'NAME_STUDENT' are have higher frequency compared to others, except 'O' label.
- minimum token length is 69, maximum token length is 3298.
- 31.64% of the documents have token length <= 512.
- for documents with at leaset one PII entity, 16.93% of them have token length <= 512.
- 76.74% of the PII entity tokens at position <= 512 in a document.
- if a pre-trained transformer model receives an input sequence with a maximum length of 512 tokens, any tokens beyond position 512 will not be used during training.

What we can do:
- collect external data to increase label for entities 'ID_NUM', 'EMAIL', 'URL_PERSONAL', 'PHONE_NUM' and 'STREET_ADDRESS'.
- down sample 'O' label.
- use stride in tokenazation process, stride helps break up large document into smaller ones with overlapping tokens.
- split the text to multiple sub-texts.
- upper whisker end of the position of PII token is 1184, we can fine tune a model which accept longer input sequence to include as much as possible PII tokens without striding the tokens.

## Key Takeaway
- EDA is crucial in the modeling process.
- Typically, larger models tend to outperform smaller ones.
- Consider experimenting with a small model, as larger model demand greater computational resources and longer training time.
- Models that do well during training might not perform as expected on new, unseen data. Keeping an eye on their performance from time to time is crucial.

## Future Work
- Experiment different pretrained models with different hyperparameters.
  - [Pretrained_Models](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v2.9.1/pretrained_models.html)
  - [microsoft/DeBERTa](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa)
- Experiment ensemble modeling.
- Participatie in more Kaggle competition and learn from others.
